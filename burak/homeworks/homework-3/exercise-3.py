#Exponents
"""
Python can also perform exponentiation. In written math, you might see an exponent as a superscript number, 
but typing superscript numbers isn’t always easy on modern keyboards. Since this operation is so related to 
multiplication, we use the notation **.
---------------------------------------------
    # 2 to the 10th power, or 1024
    print(2 ** 10)

    # 8 squared, or 64
    print(8 ** 2)

    # 9 * 9 * 9, 9 cubed, or 729
    print(9 ** 3)

    # We can even perform fractional exponents
    # 4 to the half power, or 2
    print(4 ** 0.5)
---------------------------------------------------
Here, we compute some simple exponents. We calculate 2 to the 10th power, 8 to the 2nd power, 9 to the 3rd 
power, and 4 to the 0.5th power.

#Instructions
"""
1.
You really like how the square quilts from last exercise came out, and decide that all quilts that you make
 will be square from now on.

Using the exponent operator, print out how many squares you’ll need for a 6x6 quilt, a 7x7 quilt, and an 8x8 
quilt.

2.
Your 6x6 quilts have taken off so well, 6 people have each requested 6 quilts. Print out how many tiles you 
would need to make 6 quilts apiece for 6 people.
